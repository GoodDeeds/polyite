# Polyite: Iterative Schedule Optimization for Parallelization in the Polyhedron Model

## Description
Polyite is a tool that iteratively optimizes the schedule of a program that is representable in the [Polyhedron Model](http://polyhedral.info) in order to exploit the computing capacity of a given multi-core hardware.

The exploration of the schedule search space can be done either at random or in a guided fashion using a genetic algorithm.

We describe the approach in detail in our TACO'2017 article [Iterative Schedule Optimization for Parallelization in the Polyhedron Model](https://stganser.bitbucket.io/taco2017/).

## Legal
Polyite is released under MIT license.

Polyite depends on LLVM, Clang, Polly, isl, libbarvinok and Armin Größlinger's Chernikova implementation of Chernikova's algorithm. LLVM, Clang and Polly are released under the LLVM Release License or derivates of it. isl and Chernikova are released under MIT license. libbarvinok is GPL licensed.

## Installation and Setup
We start from the bottom up with the dependences of Polyite and install everything inside the same directory, which could be your IDE's workspace.

We explain how to get Polyite running for the benchmarks from the [Polybench 4.1](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~pouchet.2/software/polybench/) benchmark suite.

```bash
export BASE_DIR=$PWD
```

### Polly/LLVM
Polyite uses an extended version Polly 3.9.1 (for the TACO'2017 we used 3.9) that is capable of importing schedule trees from our extended JSCOP format and
further transforming the imported schedules, for instance by tiling them. Therefore, you must clone LLVM, Clang and Polly from our specially provided repositories.

1. Create a root directory for LLVM
```bash
mkdir llvm_root
export LLVM_ROOT="${BASE_DIR}/llvm_root"
```

2. Clone LLVM
```bash
cd ${LLVM_ROOT}
git clone https://github.com/stganser/llvm.git
```

3. Get Clang
``` bash
cd ${LLVM_ROOT}/llvm/tools
git clone https://github.com/stganser/clang.git
```

4. Get Polly
```bash
cd ${LLVM_ROOT}/llvm/tools
git clone https://github.com/stganser/polly.git
```

5. Create a build directory for LLVM and build it using cmake
```bash
mkdir ${LLVM_ROOT}/llvm_build
cd ${LLVM_ROOT}/llvm_build
cmake ${LLVM_ROOT}/llvm
make
```

### isl Scala Bindings

1. Make sure you have libgmp and libclang (both including headers) installed on your system, as well as libtool

2. Get and build isl
```bash
cd ${BASE_DIR}
git clone https://github.com/stganser/isl.git
cd isl
mkdir install
export ISL_INSTALL="${PWD}/install"
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=${ISL_INSTALL} --with-jni-include=/usr/lib/jvm/default-java/include/ --with-clang=system
```

3. Generate the bindings
```bash
cd ${BASE_DIR}/isl/interface
make isl-scala.jar
cp -r java/gen src
cp scala/src/isl/Conversions.scala src/isl
zip -r isl-scala.jar src
```
The last three steps include the source code of the bindings into the generated library.

### Wrapper for the isl Scala Bindings
This subproject makes the isl Scala bindings accessible to Polyite.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
cd ${BASE_DIR}
git clone https://github.com/stganser/scala-isl-utils.git
cd ${BASE_DIR}/scala-isl-utils
export ISL_UTILS_ROOT=${BASE_DIR}/scala-isl-utils
mkdir libs
cp ${BASE_DIR}/isl/interface/isl-scala.jar libs
cp ${ISL_INSTALL}/lib/libisl*so* libs
```

### Barvinok Library

libbarvinok provides an implementation of Barvinok's counting algorithm, which
can be used to determine a polyhedron's volume. Since we do not have Scala bindings for libbarvinok, Polyite calls a small C-binary when it needs to determine a polyhedron's volume.

1. Clone the repositories:
```bash
cd ${BASE_DIR}
git clone http://repo.or.cz/barvinok.git
git checkout barvinok-0.39
export BARVINOK_INSTALL=barvinok/install
git clone https://github.com/stganser/barvinok_binary.git
export BARVINOK_BINARY_ROOT=${BASE_DIR}/barvinok_binary
```

2. Follow the projects' build instructions and make sure that you install libbarvinok to `${BASE_DIR}/barvinok/install`.

### Chernikova
This Scala library provides an implementation of Chernikova's algorithm to switch between the constraints representation and the generator representation of polyhedra.

```bash
cd ${BASE_DIR}
git clone https://github.com/stganser/chernikova.git
export CHERNIKOVA_ROOT=${BASE_DIR}/chernikova
```

### Polyite
The following steps describe how obtain Polyite itself and put everything together to run benchmarks from Polybench 4.1. Since we do not provide the configuration for a build tool, such as sbt, the easiest way to build Polyite is probably by using [Scala IDE](http://scala-ide.org/).

1. Get the code:
```bash
cd ${BASE_DIR}
git clone https://github.com/stganser/polyite.git
export POLYITE_ROOT=${BASE_DIR}/polyite
```
2. Download required libraries
```bash
cd ${POLYITE_ROOT}
mkdir libs
```
Now, download Scala 2.11.6 from [http://www.scala-lang.org/download/2.11.6.html](http://www.scala-lang.org/download/2.11.6.html) and copy `scala-2.11.6/lib/scala-library.jar` and `scala-2.11.6/lib/scala-parser-combinators_2.11-1.0.3.jar` to `${POLYITE_ROOT}/libs`

3. Import the projects polyite and scala-isl-utils in Scala IDE/ Eclipse and build everything. Make sure that the libraries in `${POLYITE_ROOT}/libs` are in your build path, as well as `${ISL_UTILS_BASE_DIR}/libs/isl-scala.jar`. Make sure, that your Scala compiler assumes Scala version 2.11. Make chernikova and scala-isl-utils depend on the downloaded Scala version as well and make chernikova depend on scala-isl-utils.

4. To use Polyite, one must execute one of the following scripts, depending on
the desired execution mode. The scripts assume that you have OpenJDK 8 installed
in `/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-amd64/` (the default location on Debian based systems).
  * `run_genetic_opt` to execute the genetic algorithm
  * `run_rand_exploration` to execute random exploration
  * `run_rand_exploration_letsee` to execute random exploration using the search space construction described in Pouchet et al., PLDI'08.

  The script `print_scop_size` extracts several SCoP metrics during benchmark preparation.

  In each of the scripts, set
  * `ISL_UTILS_LOC` to the value of `${ISL_UTILS_PATH}`
  * `POLYITE_LOC` to the value of `${POLYITE_ROOT}`
  * `CHERNIKOVA_LOC` to the value of `${CHERNIKOVA_ROOT}`

5. To compile and execute a schedule in order to determine its profitability, Polyite starts the script `measure_polybench.bash`. At the top of script, set
`POLLY_INSTALL_DIR` to the value of `${LLVM_ROOT}/llvm_build`.

6. The scripts in `${POLYITE_ROOT}/polybench_scripts/` are used to prepare Polybench 4.1 benchmarks for optimization with Polyite. They generate prepared LLVM-IR code, execute baseline measurements, compute reference output and generate configuration files for random exploration or optimization with the
genetic algorithm.
  * In `measureBaseline.bash` set `POLLY_INSTALL_DIR` to the value of `${LLVM_ROOT}/llvm_build`.
  * In `prepare_benchmarks.bash` set `POLLY_INSTALL_DIR` to the value of `${LLVM_ROOT}/llvm_build` and `POLYITE_LOC` to the value of `{POLYITE_ROOT}`. This script can later be called to prepare a list of Polybench 4.1 benchmarks. You may want to adapt the values of the default
  configuration files that the script generates for each benchmark. Compile `${POLYITE_ROOT}/config_help.tex` to get a documentation of Polyite's configuration options.
  * The file `polly_configurations.txt` contains a list of Polly configurations
  that `prepare_benchmarks.bash` considers during the baseline measurements.

7. Download [Polybench 4.1](https://sourceforge.net/projects/polybench/files/polybench-c-4.1.tar.gz/download) and unpack the archive to `${POLYITE_ROOT}/polybench-c-4.1`.

8. Create symbolic links in `polybench-c-4.1`:
```bash
cd ${POLYITE_ROOT}/polybench-c-4.1
ln -s ../polybench_scripts/baselineCollectData.bash baselineCollectData.bash
ln -s ../polybench_scripts/collectAllBaselineResults.bash collectAllBaselineResults.bash
ln -s ../polybench_scripts/generateRefOut.bash generateRefOut.bash
ln -s ../polybench_scripts/measureBaseline.bash measureBaseline.bash
ln -s ../polybench_scripts/prepare_benchmarks.bash prepare_benchmarks.bash
```
## Usage
To prepare benchmark gemm perform the following steps:
```bash
cd ${POLYITE_ROOT}/polybench-c-4.1
./prepare_benchmarks.bash true false false gemm
```
This creates the directory `polybench-c-4.1/gemm` with the following content:
```
config_ga_gemm_kernel_gemm_%entry.split---%for.end40.properties
config_rand_gemm_kernel_gemm_%entry.split---%for.end40.properties
gemm.preopt.ll
gemm.preopt.ll.dump_arrays
gemm.preopt.ll.papi
gemm.preopt.ll.time
kernel_gemm___%entry.split---%for.end40.jscop
ref_output
```
There are
  * configuration files for random exploration and optimization with the genetic algorithm. To understand and modify these, compile and read `${POLYITE_ROOT}/config_help.tex`.
  * several prepared LLVM-IR files. These are linked and can be compiled to a runnable binary.
  * A JSCOP file that contains the model of the SCoP to optimize.
  * A file containing reference output that was produced by a binary compiled with
  -O0.
To change the code regions to optimize (Polyite can optimize one SCoP at a time) or change data set sizes, edit the file `polybench-c-4.1/benchmarks.txt`.

Now, you can run schedule optimization with the genetic algorithm:
```bash
cd ${POLYITE_ROOT}
./run_genetic_opt_openjdk polybench-c-4.1/gemm/kernel_gemm___%entry.split---%for.end40.jscop polybench-c-4.1/gemm/config_ga_gemm_kernel_gemm_%entry.split---%for.end40.properties
```
Depending on your configuration, this produces one JSON file per generation of
the genetic algorithm, one CSV file and a directory containing one JSCOP file per schedule for manual application of the generated schedules. The JSON files
contain all attributes of the generated schedules and can be read by Polyite, for instance, in order to restart an interrupted run of the genetic algorithm or
to generate further generations.

Analogously, random exploration can be run, using

```bash
cd ${POLYITE_ROOT}
./run_rand_exploration polybench-c-4.1/gemm/kernel_gemm___%entry.split---%for.end40.jscop polybench-c-4.1/gemm/config_rand_gemm_kernel_gemm_%entry.split---%for.end40.properties
```

To use SLURM for the evaluation of your schedules, put something like the following into your configuration file:
```bash
numMeasurementThreads=42
measurementCommand=srun -Aduckdonald -pthebigcluster --constraint=fastest_cpu_available_plx --mem=32768 --exclusive -t31 -n1 ${POLYITE_ROOT}/measure_polybench.bash
```
It is important to use `srun`, since Polyite must be able into interactively communicate with the benchmarking script via STDIN and STDOUT. Polyite can pass
a given [numactl](https://github.com/numactl/numactl) configuration to the benchmarking script.
